# Ball-Racket
A ball-racket game designed in Racket. 

You need some sort of IDE to run this game: Dr Racket 6.10.1
Once the code has been copied on the IDE, just write to following function to start the gane:
*(simulation x)* 
x can be any value u want to give to this simulation. x determines the speed at which the ball will move (0.05 is fine to start with)

You can create more balls by pressing *B*.The game halts once u press space bar.

Implementation:
Functions like Map, filter and foldr has been used to manipulate lists or to implement recursion.
